potatolang (pol) is a Lua intepreter written in golang. It adapts most features in Lua 5.x with some extra enhancements, though its VM design is a whole different system.

## Can & Can't

- `1 + "2"` and `"1" .. 2` are not permitted, you should write `1 + tonumber("2")` and `"1" .. tostring(2)`, or implement their metamethods.
- You can `return` anywhere in the function, `continue` in a for loop, and use `yield` as a keyword:
    - `for k in (function () yield 1 end) do assert(k == 1)`
- You can `goto` anywhere in the function so be careful about uninitialized variables.
- Multiple assignment is Go alike, say `f` returns 2 values:
    - `f() -- OK, but with side effect`
    - `a = f() -- OK, same side effect as above`
    - `a, b = f() -- OK`
    - `a, b, c = f(), 1 -- Invalid`
    - `a, b, c = 1, f() -- OK by chance`
- You can `+=`, `-=`, `*=` and `/=`.
- Variadic functions are completely different, `...` is actually a valid symbol name, you should treat and use them like Go. The following code won't work as expected (while they can be compiled anyway): 
    - `return ... -- Returning a single variable '...'`
    - `(function (a, ...) end)(unpack({a, b})) -- Unpack across fixed and variadic args`
    - `(function (a, ...) end)(a, b, unpack({c})) - Unpack not filling up all variadic args`
    - `{...}` will create a copy of `...`, for performance reason, you should:
        - `#...`, `...[index]` and `...[index] = value`
        - `pack(...)` will create a table using varargs directly as its underlay
- You can define more than 255 variables in a function (up to ~800, depending on the number of temporal variables generated by interpreter)

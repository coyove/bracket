potatolang (pol) is a Lua intepreter written in golang. It adapts most features in Lua 5.x with some extra enhancements, though its VM design is a whole different system.

## Can & Can't

- `1 + "2"` and `"1" .. 2` are not permitted, you should write `1 + tonumber("2")` and `"1" .. tostring(2)`, or implement their metamethods.
- You can `return` anywhere in the function
- You can use `yield` as a keyword:
    - `for k in (function () yield 1 end) do assert(k == 1)`
    - Thus, there is no `thread` type in pol, because every function is a coroutine
- You can `goto` anywhere in the function so be careful about uninitialized variables.
- You can `+=`, `-=`, `*=` and `/=`.
- You can use `...` to catch returned arguments and pass them to another function: `local n, ... = foo(); print(...)`
- `{...}` will create a copy of `...`, for performance reason, you should:
    - Direct access: `#...`, `...[index]`
    - `pack(...)` will create a table using varargs directly as its underlay
- You can define more than 255 variables in a function (up to ~800, depending on the number of temporal variables generated by interpreter)
- [return vs return nil](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18522299/returning-nil-from-a-lua-function-in-c-vs-returning-0-values): they are EXACTLY IDENTICAL to each other in pol, so you will get three `1` as outputs

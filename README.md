potatolang (pol) is a Lua intepreter written in golang. It adapts most features in Lua 5.x with some extra enhancements, though its VM design is a whole different system.

## Can & Can't

- `1 + "2"` and `"1" .. 2` are not permitted, you should write `1 + tonumber("2")` and `"1" .. tostring(2)`, or implement their metamethods.
- You can `return` anywhere in the function
- You can use `yield` as a keyword:
    - `for k in (function () yield 1 end) do assert(k == 1)`
    - Thus, there is no `thread` type in pol, because every function is a coroutine
- You can `goto` anywhere in the function so be careful about uninitialized variables.
- You can `+=`, `-=`, `*=` and `/=`.
- Variadic functions are completely different, `...` is actually a valid symbol name, you should treat and use them like Go. The following code won't work as expected (while they can be compiled anyway): 
    - `return ... -- returning a single variable '...'`
    - `(function (a, ...) end)(unpack({a, b})) -- unpack across fixed and variadic args`
    - `(function (a, ...) end)(a, b, unpack({c})) -- unpack not filling up all variadic args`
    - `print( (function() return 1, 2, 3 end)() ) -- only prints 1`
        - You
    - `{...}` will create a copy of `...`, for performance reason, you should:
        - `#...`, `...[index]` and `...[index] = value`
        - `pack(...)` will create a table using varargs directly as its underlay
- You can define more than 255 variables in a function (up to ~800, depending on the number of temporal variables generated by interpreter)

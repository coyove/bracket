potatolang (pol) is a Lua intepreter written in golang. It adapts most features in Lua 5.x with some extra enhancements, though its VM design is a whole different system.

## Can & Can't

- You can `return` anywhere in the function, `continue` in a for loop, and use `yield` as a keyword:
    - `for k in (function () yield 1 end) do assert(k == 1)`
- Multiple assignment is Go alike, say `f` returns 2 values:
    - `local a, b = f() -- OK`
    - `a, b, c = f(), 1 -- INVALID`
    - `a, b, c = 1, f() -- OK by chance`
- You can `+=`, `-=`, `*=` and `/=`.
- Variadic functions are completely different, `...` is a syntax sugar of `unpack(arg)`, you should treat and use them like Go. You can't write following code: 
    - `return ...`
    - `(function (a, ...) end)(unpack({a, b}))`
- Caller should give exact number of arguments to callee, no more no less no panic:
    - `(function (a) end)() -- INVALID`
    - `(function (a) end)(1, 2) -- INVALID`
- You can define more than 255 variables in a function (up to ~800, depending on the number of temporal variables generated by interpreter)

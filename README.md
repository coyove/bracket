`script` is a simple script engine written in golang with Lua-like syntax. [Playground](http://play.fweibo.com)

(If you are looking for a Lua 5.2 compatible engine, refer to tag `v0.2`)

## Can & Can't

- You can't create closures inside the script, but you can return functions to Go callers which naturally have one.
- You can't use `bool`, actually `true == 1 and false == 0`. If you do want them, use `True` and `False`.
- You can't use `table` but only `array`.
- You can't write variadic functions.
- You can `return` and `goto` anywhere in the function.
- You can `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=` and `%=`.
- You can define more than 255 variables in a function (up to ~4000, depending on the number of temporal variables generated by interpreter)
- You can call a function optionally (say `foo` has 26 parameters from `a` to `z`): `foo(a=1, m=2, z=3)`
- You can slice `string`, `array`, `reflect.Slice` and/or `reflect.Array`: `("string")[1:3] == "str"`, `a[1:2]`. Always keep in mind that index starts from 1 and ends inclusively
- [return vs return nil](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18522299/returning-nil-from-a-lua-function-in-c-vs-returning-0-values): they are EXACTLY IDENTICAL to each other in `script`, so you will get three `1` as outputs
- `number` is `int64+float64` internally, math operations may promote it to `float64` when needed and downgrade it to `int64` when possible

## Run

```golang
program, err := script.LoadString("return 1")
v, err := program.Run() // v == 1
```

### Global Values

```golang
script.AddGlobalValue("G", func() int { return 1 })

program, _ := script.LoadString("return G() + 1")
v, err := program.Run() // v == 2

program, _ = script.LoadString("return G() + 2")
v, err = program.Run() // v == 3

program, _ = script.LoadString("return G + 2", CompileOptions{
	GlobalKeyValues: {
		"G": 10, // override the global 'G'
	},
})
v, err = program.Run() // v == 12
```

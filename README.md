potatolang (pol) is a Lua dialect written in golang with many features being ripped off to keep it simple.

## Can & Can't

- You can't use closures, e.g.: `function () local a = 1 return function() a = a + 1 end end`
- You can `return` anywhere in the function
- You can use `yield` as a keyword:
    - `for k in (function () yield 1 end) do assert(k == 1)`
    - Thus, there is no `thread` type in pol, because every function is a coroutine
- You can `goto` anywhere in the function so be careful about uninitialized variables.
- You can `+=`, `-=`, `*=` and `/=`.
- You can use `...` to catch returned arguments and pass them to another function: `local n, ... = foo(); print(...)`
- You can directly access: `#...` and `...[index]`
- You can define more than 255 variables in a function (up to ~800, depending on the number of temporal variables generated by interpreter)
- [return vs return nil](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18522299/returning-nil-from-a-lua-function-in-c-vs-returning-0-values): they are EXACTLY IDENTICAL to each other in pol, so you will get three `1` as outputs
- There is no `bool`
